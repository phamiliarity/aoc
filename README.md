# Advent of Code 

My code solutions for Advent of Code. Scripts in the main directory are my first working attempt without any retroactive modifications. I mainly focus on code correctness. When you come across bad coding practices: turn a blind eye to these, please and thank you!

## Revisited solutions
Sometimes I get inspired by others or by my own attempt to try a different approach or make scripts more concise. I upload the revisited scripts in the 'revisited' subdirectory. The readability of these scripts will likely be worse than the original attempt.
