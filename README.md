# Advent of Code 

My code solutions for Advent of Code, organised by year. I upload my first working attempt without any retroactive modifications. I mainly focus on code correctness.* When you come across bad coding practices or random artifacts: turn a blind eye to these, please and thank you!

*note: as a rule of thumb, scripts will be barely readable if i know what im doing. for days i find more difficult, the script will likely be better in terms of reability and modularity to make debugging easier :)

## Revisited solutions
Sometimes I get inspired by others or by my own attempt to try a different approach or make scripts more concise. Revisited scripts are uploaded in the 'revisited' subdirectory. The readability of these scripts will likely be worse than the original attempt.
